Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using Logistic Regression in Python. By analyzing health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more, the model helps classify patients as at risk (1) or not at risk (0), assisting in early detection and preventive healthcare.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

We use the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains patient medical attributes.

Features include:

age â†’ Age of the patient

sex â†’ Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)

chestpain â†’ Chest pain type (0â€“3)

trestbloodpressure â†’ Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)

chol â†’ Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)

fastingbloodsugar â†’ Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)

restecg â†’ Resting ECG results (0, 1, 2)

maximumheartrateachieve â†’ Maximum heart rate achieved

exerciseangina â†’ Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

oldpeakdep â†’ ST depression induced by exercise

slopexercise â†’ Slope of peak exercise ST segment

ca â†’ Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy

thal â†’ Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)

target â†’ Heart disease (1 = present, 0 = not present)
